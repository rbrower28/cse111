Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

    Small Business Assistant

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

    Scheduling appts and sales for running a one-person business

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

    I will learn how to make an interface that takes and displays calendar information,
    as well as retrieve and store that information from Firebase.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

    I'll use tkinter and requests

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    The functions will include add_sale, add_appt, and display_calendar(start_date, end_date)

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

    I'll test if the display_calendar function has all of the correct items from Firebase
